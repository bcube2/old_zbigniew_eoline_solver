Notes:

1) it does not work properly on mobile devices
2) click on the Random Algorithm button to generate the scrambling sequence
3) adjust the height of the text area to see the scrambling sequence properly
4) click on the Solve! button and wait until the number of necessary moves is shown
5) click on the Show solutions button to see generated solutions
6) if you want to input your own scrambling sequence, type/paste it into the text area - it 
   is not user friendly but one workaround which is working for me is clicking on the 
   Random Algorithm button first, then clicking around 1 cm after the last letter in the 
   scrambling sequence in order to edit the scrambling sequence in the text area
